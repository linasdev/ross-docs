# Interfaces
Interfaces are hardware specific ways of transferring [packets](../packets.md). Currently ross uses [CAN](./can.md), [USART](./usart.md) and [Serial](./serial.md). The difference between USART and serial is that USART is the interface used on the ross system side and serial is the interface used on the computer side.
